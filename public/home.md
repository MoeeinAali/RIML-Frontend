# Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning

Welcome to the <strong class="text-primary underline">RIML Lab</strong> at Sharif University of
Technology,
led by <strong class="text-primary underline">Dr. Mohammad
Hossein Rohban</strong>. We focus on developing robust and interpretable machine learning solutions,
addressing challenges in anomaly detection, adversarial robustness, and computational biology.
Let's grow together.â€‹

## About the Lab

At RIML Lab, we focus on creating machine learning algorithms that can withstand adversarial conditions
and provide insights into their decision-making processes. Our research aims to bridge the gap between
theoretical advancements and practical implementations, ensuring that AI systems are both effective and
trustworthy.

## Our Goals

By embodying these principles, the RIML Lab aims to be a beacon of excellence in machine
learning
research, contributing to a more vibrant, growing, self-actualized, and sustainable world.
